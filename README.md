## Introduction
### Disclaimer: This was an older project of mine tailored to improve my skills in developing a frontend from a premade design. It ultimately helped me understand how to work on frontends with precision and responsiveness.

A fully responsive and dynamic marketing site for a photo-sharing app that utilizes complex and engaging CSS for a unique content flow. This project is from www.frontendmentor.io, which provided the design specifications and basic graphics to showcase the desired final product. All the images and icons were provided alongside the design as part of their premium subscription. The main aim of the project was to showcase high-level CSS and the ability to convert complex designs into a functional and interactive final product. 

## Showcase
### Index
Without showcasing every page, I will demonstrate one of the main focus points of the project through the index page. As previously mentioned, the goal was to demonstrate clean and gradual transitioning between all valid device sizes. To accomplish this, I relied heavily on CSS grid and followed the design specifications with utmost precision to ensure the content works well at any size. Alongside this, all animations, hover effects, and JavaScript functionality were implemented exactly as specified in the design.

## Room for Improvement
The project went quite well, as the efficiency of the production was high throughout. However, several improvements could have been made. One such improvement would have been a more strategic approach to how the initial groundwork was built; since much of the website followed a similar layout, I could have reduced the amount of CSS required by better recognizing these similarities and creating more universal classes to allow easy sharing of styling properties. 

React also would have been a great framework to utilize in this project, especially for the creation of stories and to allow for higher maintainability and possible expansion. However, this was a purposeful decision, as the primary focus of the project was CSS and HTML. Introducing React would have diluted attention and resources from that core focus. 

Overall, the project went smoothly, as I was able to handle the complex responsiveness needed through CSS grid and modern CSS features such as `clamp` to handle content resizing more dynamically.

## Notes
Some alterations were made in the final product that do not align with the original design specifications which was a purpose attempt to positively tweak the design. Many of these changes include introducing more accessible font sizing and animations to improve usability. Additionally, some responsive behavior was altered to ensure better utilization of space for improved readability. Certain stylistic choices in the original design affected the websiteâ€™s ability to be easily digestible and navigable. Due to this, adjustments were made for the benefit of the final product.
